*       This file provides a set of pseudo-operations that are intended     *
*       to replace existing mnemonics in certain usage scenarios.  The      *
*       point of the new pseudo-ops is to allow the tools to provide more   *
*       precise information to the profiler as to the *purpose* of a        *
*       branch, so that it can provide more accurate profile data.          *
*                                                                           *

*                   Equivalent to "LB", but only accepts *XAR7 as an        *
*                   operand.                                                *

*       This file is actually just a compatibility shim, intended to        *
*       provide forward compatibility between tool versions < 5.00          *
*       and tool versions >= 5.00.  The purpose of this file it purely      *
*       compatibility.  Tool versions >= 5.00 are required to gain the      *
*       greater-precision information for the profiler.                     *
