    <configuration XML_version="1.2" description="Simulates the C64x+ core in a cycle accurate manner. Supports timers(3) and a flat memory system. Does not simulate the cache system and any peripherals.  Use this configuration for core level algorithms development (including BIOS based development) and benchmarking, for any C64x+ based device. This configuration is faster than the Megamodule and device level configurations. &#10; Note on other configurations for this processor: &#10; * Choose the Megamodule configuration for developing &amp; benchmarking applications for cache usage; &#10; * Choose the device configurations for developing applications that use modules beyond the Megamodule.
