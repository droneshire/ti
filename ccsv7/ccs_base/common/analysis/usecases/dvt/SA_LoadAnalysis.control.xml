		ExecutionGraph.Tip=Select this feature to see Execution Graph showing timeline of Tasks, SWIs and HWIs, Semaphore, RTOS events, Benchmark Start/Stop events and Profile Enter/Exit events. Events must be enabled and/or instrumented on target application to be visible. 
		Concurrency.Tip=Select this feature to analyze how efficiently the application is utilizing multi-core. RTOS context switch events must be enabled on all required cores for this analysis.
		ContextAwareProfile.Tip=Select this feature to get Function inclusive and exclusive time based on Profile Enter/Exit events instrumentation. Enable RTOS Context Switch events to get context aware profiling.
		Duration.Tip=Select this feature to analyze Benchmark Start/Stop events.
		TaskProfiler.Tip=Select this feature analyze the time tasks are spending in different states. RTOS Context Switch events must be enabled.
		CPULoad.Tip=Select this feature to see CPU load graph and load summary statistics. RTOS load logging must be enabled.
		TaskLoad.Tip=Select this feature to see the loading of each task, HWI and/or SWIs are putting on the CPU. The corresponding RTOS load logging must be enabled.
		CountAnalysis.Tip=Select this feature to get statistics of any value logged in the application.
		PrintfLogs.Tip=Select this feature to open the Printf log view showing Error, Warning, Info and Print Events
