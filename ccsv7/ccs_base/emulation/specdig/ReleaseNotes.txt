Release  5.2.0.14 Windows/Linux
- Update the XDS2xx firmware for SWO support using eDMA.
  This update must be programmed into the XDS2xx. See readme.txt in the

  <CCS_INSTALL_DIR>\ccs_base\emulation\specdig\xds2xx directory.

Release  5.2.0.13 Windows/Linux
- Update the XDS2xx firmware to address the following bugs as
  reported by TI. New firmware is v1.0.0.6.

	SDSCM00050714 XDS200: bcdUSB should be 0x0200 or 0x0210
	SDSCM00050694 XDS200: HIgh-Speed Bulk wMaxPacketSize must be 512
	SDSCM00050691 XDS200 emulators do not work with USB3.0 host ports

  This update must be programmed into the XDS2xx. See readme.txt in the

  <CCS_INSTALL_DIR>\ccs_base\emulation\specdig\xds2xx directory.

Release  5.2.0.12 Windows/Linux
- Work around a trace induced bug in CCS v6. The trace driver
  started calling an APB function during startup which would
  hang. Unfortunately there is no clean way to disable trace
  even when you do not want it.  Affected files:
    sdgodap_pc.dvr  - xds510 pp
    sdgocs_dap.dvr  - xds510 pp
    sdxds510usbplus_v12.out - xds510 usb
    sdxds510usb_v11.out - xds510 usb

Release  5.2.0.11 Windows
- Add driver xml support for Cortex R5
    sdxds510usbjsccortexR.XML
    sdgocortexRusb.xml
    sdgocortexR.XML

Release  5.2.0.10 Windows 
- Update sddllmgt2.dll to support newer C28x CLA.
- Add XDS510USB driver xml for new C28x CLA.

Release  5.2.0.09 Windows : 5.2.0.09 Linux
- Update xds2xx_conf time out for the boot command from 15 secnds
  to 25 seconds.
- Update the XDS560v2 PRO connection xml to support a RTCK loopback
  mode.  This is used to work around poor emulation TCK/RTCK
  routing on some TCI66xx boards.

Release  5.2.0.08 Windows : 5.2.0.08 Linux
- Added Cortex M SWD/SWO support files.  This requires a firmware
  and CPLD update to your XDS200/XDS220.  See the readme in the
  specdig\xds2xx directory for details.
- Cleaned up some C55 gel files.

Release  5.2.0.07 Windows : 5.2.0.07 Linux
- Windows only: Fix Sd560v2Config "Update" command. Release
  5.2.0.04 introduced a bug that would prevent updates.
- Update the XDS2xx LAN connection file to use TIXDS200 vs
  TIXDS560 as the connection type.  This fix was requested by
  TI and is dependent on TI emulation pack 5.0.952.0 which has
  updated driver connection files.  This fix resolves the issue
  of older unsupported processors being available on XDS2xx
  class products.

Release  5.2.0.06 Windows : 5.2.0.06 Linux
- Remove "STM" from XDS560v2 PRO connection files. It seems TI
  removed "STM" from it's version of the files after making request
  for SD to add.

Release  5.2.0.05 Windows : 5.2.0.05 Linux
- TMS470/CortexM FLASH work around. The erase algo appears to 
  cause a reset vector catch event which SD drivers report
  back as a HW breakpoint which causes the algo to exit.  This
  only occurs when erasing a blank FLASH.  Work around is to
  filter this event and suppress the HW breakpoint status.
- Update XDS220 current measurement application.
- Add in XDS560v2 PRO connection files so that TI can remove
  from its emupack.

Release  5.2.0.04 Windows : 5.2.0.04 Linux
- Add xds200 support utilities (emulation\specdig\xds2xx).
- Add xds220 emulation drivers and connection support.
- Fix Sd560v2Config "restore" command.  On XDS560v2 LC
  Traveler a "restore" command did not set the LC Traveler
  specific parameters after the restore.  The result is that
  the wrong FPGA image would be loaded and USCIF would fail.

Release  5.2.0.03 Windows : 5.2.0.03 Linux
- Update ARP32 support to include it's own emulation driver,
  sdgoarp32usb.dvr. This addresses ARP32 slow download. APR32 
  and IHWA support is only included on Windows releases for 
  the XDS510USB and XDS510USB-PLUS.

Release  5.2.0.02 Windows : 5.2.0.02 Linux
- Rebuild with TI's latest P2 installer for improved update support.

Release  5.2.0.01 Windows
- Update sddllmgt2.dll to suport arp32.
- Add driver xml to support arp32, sdxds510usbarp32usb.xml.

Release  5.2.0.00 Windows : Linux CCS 5.2.0.00
- Update sdjtag to fix "Test Connection" error seen on XDS510USB.
- Update xds510pp-plus drivers to resolve an "emulator reset" failure.
- Add hardware disconnect flag on ccs disconnect to xds510usb connection xml
    for flash470 support.
- Add config xml and gel files for ezdsp5535 and ezdsp5502.
- Update board xml to work in both windows and linux environments.

Release  5.1.1.08 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.1.08
- Update installers to better support CCSv5.1 p2 update process.
- Update ARM9 drivers to re-enable "System Reset".
- Change connection description for XDS510USB JSC drivers to:
    "Spectrum Digital XDS510USB Emulator TI-JSC"
  Having "Plus" in the name gives the user the impression
  that the JSC drivers should be used on the XDS510USB-Plus by default. 
  The TI-JSC drivers only work on the XDS510USB-Plus but should
  only be used as a last resort on TI devices which may have unknown
  processor configurations.  TI-JSC drivers use XDS100v2 class drivers
  and have roughly the same performance.

Release  5.1.1.07 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.1.07
- Add sdgopruusb.dvr for DAP based pru support. Can not use
   the TI xds510 driver for DAP.
- Update sdgoihwausb.dvr to current DAP based ihwa support.
- Update pru and ihwa driver xml.
- Remove unused iva1 and iva2 driver xml.
- Update sdgoetidapusb.dll error support for pru and ihwa.

Release  5.1.1.06 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.1.06
-  Add Cortex M4 to driver xml.
-  Update evmam1707.xml to fix to fix Linux / issue.
-  Modify the XDS560v2 connection xml to set the default freqency in adaptive
   mode to the legacy 10.368MHz.

-  Add Diagnostic Command support for XDS510USB/PLUS xml.
-  Update XDS560v2 host side USB support to handle Linux target side musb dropping
   a packet every so often.
-  Include XDS560v2 firmware sd_xds560v2_firmware_2.2.0.5.  This firmware was
   already available on the SD xds560v2 site.  See the xds560v2 website for details.

Release   4.2.3.03
-  Patch TI ecom/fpga files into CCSv4 to support XDS560v2 LC Traveler. 
   Customers should update to CCS v5.1 for more complete support.

Release   5.1.1.05 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.1.05
-  Windows, update SDFlash to v1.65 to support device unlock for newer F28xx devices.
-  Windows, add prog28x.exe to the SDFlash release for command line programming support. 
   Source to prog28x.exe is posted on the SD web site at
        http://emulators.spectrumdigital.com/utilities/sdflash/.
-  Update InstallJammer logfile path at TI request.
-  Update sdgoxds510dsk.xml to fix C674x ProcID and add in TraceDeviceId.


Release   5.1.1.04 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.1.04
-  Update XDS560v2 configuration xml to include "Diagnostic Command" settings.

Release   5.1.1.03 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.1.03
-  Update XDS560v2 configuration xml to include cjtag settings.

Release   4.2.3.02, 5.1.1.02 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.1.02
-  Update the  CortexM3 cio breakpoint work around to resolve issue of
   skipping over hardware breakpoints on Stellaris.

Release   5.1.1.01 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.1.01
-   Windows only 5.1.x.x: Installer update to put jsc files into the uscif
    directory, again!!
-   Reenable XDS510USB STM driver support. TI no longer wants to support the 
    no-stm xml in CCS 5.1.  Also resolve issue where TI wants additional
    functions exposed in Linux drivers that are not exposed in Windows.
-   Update the XDS560v2 connection xml at TI request to set default TCK
    mode to legacy and falling edge timing.  This provides better timing
    margin and connection success on many targets.  User can increase
    the TCK speed if desired.  The slower TCK will have little
    impact on CCS performance for devices that include an IcePick or Cortex
    device.

Release  4.2.2.9, 5.1.0.9 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.0.9
- Add a cio breakpoint work around in CortexM3 drivers. When interrupts are
  enabled and an interrupts occurs concurrently with execution of a breakpoint
  instruction then Cortex M3 stops at the ISR instead of the breakpoint 
  instruction address. The work around is to detect this condition and silently
  run the CortexM3 which will re-execute the breakpoint instruction.
- Update XDS560v2 drivers and firmware to support new products and minor bug
  fixes in utilities.  XDS560v2 firmware updated to 2.2.0.3.
 
Release 5.1.0.8 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.0.8 (SD development build, not released)
- Add cache/mmu disable in OnTargetConnect for davanci, am1707 and dm365
  evm gels.  This should prevent the OnTargetConnect from hanging during
  chip configuration when the EVM is running Linux.
- Update installer to InstallJammer 1.2.15.  This resolves some
  InstallJammer silent mode installation issues in Windows 7.
- Turn on installer logging.
- Remove sddllmgt.dll and sdsmg51095.dll.  These two files were used by
  the obsolete products XDS510PP (original not the PPLUS) and XDS510-ISA.
  These two obsolete products may still work in CCSv4 and higher if a CCS 3.3
  driver pack is installed, however these components are not actively 
  supported in CCSv4 and higher.
- Update USB driver file sdusb2em.inf to add new products.
- NOTE: If build x.x.x.2 or higher is installed in standalone mode then you may 
  need to install the msvc80 updates included in the CCS image.  Newer versions
  of SdConfigEx and SdFlash require the updated runtimes. Runtime updates are
  also available from Microsoft.
 
Release 5.1.0.7 Windows : Linux CCS 5.1.0.7
- Remove ccstm driver and xml files.  This forces the use of the "no_STM"
  configuration for STM enabled targets.

Release 4.2.2.6, 5.0.0.6, 5.1.0.6 Windows : Linux CCS 5.0.0.6, 5.1.0.6
-   Windows only 5.1.x.x: Installer update to put jsc files into the uscif
    directory.
-   Fix upper/lower case issues on tci6482 Linux board xml.
-   Added options for Cortex A8/R4 to improve memory download and
    upload over APB. This feature has to be enabled similar to AHB
    download for backward compatibility. A gel file cortex_apb_ahb_util.gel
    is added in boards\omap35xx_3430\gel with functions to control both
    APB and AHB.
-   Fix bug in Cortex A9 download over APB. On a download the
    very last section downloaded may not be written properly due to bug
    in TI EPK TRG_END_DOWNLOAD handling. The problem occurs when the last
    section requires multiple download passes to complete.
-   Fixed a linkage issue in linux for cs_dap drivers where uscif directory
    was not consistantly found while loading libxdsfast3.so.
-   Added additional debug support to eti_dap and M3 to help find
    APB/AHB transport problems for preliminary Cortex M0/M4 support.

Release 5.1.0.5 Windows : Linux CCS v5.1.0.5
-   Updated installer package to create timestap file at TI request.
-   Updated installer package product guids to be CCSv5.1 specific.
-   Changed the IcePick_C lower bound port# from 0x10 to 0x0 to enable
    access to test ports.
-   Set the default TCK in SD510USB_Connection.xml to 10MHz to better
    support MCU products (Stellaris) which have 10MHz TCK limit.
-   Removed SD510USB_ConnectionWithOpts.xml.  For CCS5.1 and higher move
    the options into the standard SD510USB_Connection.xml.  This also
    eliminates the need to manually edit the sdopts.cfg file in most setups.
-   Windows only 5.1.x.x: Added drivers and xml to support limited use of the 
    XDS510USB-PLUS emulator via the TI JSC interface. This allows TI 
    XDS510 class emulation drivers to run with the XDS510USB-PLUS in 
    same manner as XDS100v2.  The performance in this configuration is
    roughly the same as the XDS100v2. This is not supported on the XDS510USB
    as the USB 1.1 full speed port in combination with TI JSC is to slow
    to be usefull.

Release 4.2.2.4 and 5.0.0.4 Windows : Linux CCS v5.0.0.4
-   Rebuild/downgrade Linux drivers to remove glibc_2.4 dependency in RH4.
-   Update installation and scripts to deal with RH4.
-   Unwind some memory error/warning filters on Cortex A/R/M.
    Previous release was filtering memory write errors to match XDS560
    memory error handling in attempt to let gel files proceed for harmless
    errors/warnings.  Netra DDR3 testing showed up a gel file corner case
    where a memory write fail followed by a gel while{} memory read loop
    essentially causes CCS to hang in the while loop. The memory write
    fail needs to be passed back to CCS so that the endless gel while{} 
    loop is not executed. Endless gel while loops are bad style but they
    exist everywhere so best to just remove the filtering.
-   Recreate TCI6488 and C6474 EVM xml to work around a bug in CCS that was
    improperly generating device id's when multiple ice_pick devices were
    instanced.  This bug shows up on commands like system reset.  When
    trying to reset the 2nd multi-core device on the EVM the reset was
    always directed to th 1st multi-core device.  Once this bug is fixed
    in CCS the xml will revert back to the previous version.
    
Release 4.2.2.3 and 5.0.0.3 Windows : Linux CCS v5.0.0.3
- Add SD510USB_ConnectionWithOpts.xml and associated driver support.
    This allows the most popular sdopts.cfg options to be set or
    overriden from the ccxml.  The default is to read from sdopts.cfg
    and then override options from CCS. 
- SDSCM00038253 - failure to load symbols on C674x of omapl138: 
    Could not reproduce but suspect the issue was driver
    xml related which was fixed in 4.2.2.2/5.0.0.2.
- SDSCM00038256 - failure to halt c674x of omapl138 under Linux running
    BIOS examples. Issue resolved in C64Plus driver by not "disconnecting" on WIR.
    User must also set EmuIcePickRtrExtended=YES to enable extended IcePick router
    support. This flag can be set from CCS when using SD510USB_ConnectionWithOpts
    or by editing the sdopts.cfg file. When set more extensive but slower tap insertion
    is done.  This also requires TI PRSC properly manage/release targets for WIR.
    Note that PRSC is only available when running in a CCS/DSS environment. When
    extended router support is not enabled SD drivers will automaticly force
    clocks, power and clear WIR.

Release 4.2.2.2 and 5.0.0.2 Windows : Linux CCS v5.0.0.2
- Change proc id tag for C674x driver xml.  This tag was set to
   generic C64P.
- Add TraceId to xml as needed.
- Remove config xml and drivers for C671x, c672x, c641x under Linux.
    These drivers processors are not currently supported by CCS.

    as the firmware updates.
- XDS560v2 firmware update 2.2.0.2 to resolve USB port stalling for long
    periods during large trace uploads. 
- Print error number for PRSC generated errors to help identify PRSC
    problems when targets are held in reset or not responding.
- Move temp file/log from driver/uscif directory to user local
    temp directory, os dependent.
    Windows XP:  C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\.spectrumdigital
    Windows 7:   C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.spectrumdigital
    Linux user:  /home/<username>/.spectrumdigital
    Linux root:  /root/.spectrumdigital

Release 4.2.1.8 Windows
- Add PRU support.
- Update CLA xml support.
- Updated sddllmgt2.dll to support IVA and PRU device names.
  The long names for IVA components exposed a naming problem with
  older versions of CCS 4.x and 3.3 which share this component. The
  problem was worked around and tested for backward compatibility.
- Update DM365 GEL to reflect NAND EMIF bus sizing.

Release 4.2.1.7 Windows and Linux
- Update F28xx driver to fix SDSCM00037379 reported by TI.
- Update Cortex M/R driver xml to use "Access Port Designator" vs
  AHB port.  The new default value assigned by TI for Cortex M is
  0x02000003 and works for OMAP4/Netra class devices but causes
  a problem with LM3S devices.  For LM3S devices the user has to
  set the valaue to 0x02000000 or 0 until this is resolved by TI.
- Add usbstk5515 gel.
- Add XDS560v2 Linux support.
- Remove manually generated configurations to prevent conflicts

- Includes fixes for XDS510USB class emulators for fast close/open
  issues seen with GSS and DSS.  Each release goes into their
  respective CCS version. 

Release 4.0.32.36
- Initial release for CCS 4.2 ONLY. 

Release 4.0.0.32.27
- Partial work around CCS bug SDSCM00032477. TI to fix in CCS 4.1.
   Affects USB emulation drivers.  No updates to non-USB drivers, wait for
   CCS 4.1 fix.

- Update evmtci6488.xml for fast xml load

- Remove some of the original configurations for old processors that
    are now covered by cpu/device files.

- Update EVM5505 gel file.

- Add USBSTK5505 board and gel (preliminary).

- Remove use of "revert.exe" from the IJ installer.  Instead let IJ
    manage the update by uninstalling and reinstalling or patching
    as required.  In future releases revert.exe may be called
    from the install/uninstall xml during the update process using
    an external file list.

- Update SdConfigEx xml to support TCK loop back mode.  This will enable
   support for TI/Luminary M3 devices which do not have a return TCK.

Release 4.0.0.32.26

- Add in eclipse feature update boiler plate and setup the website.
  Cannot fully test until we understand how to wrap update installers
  for CCSv4.

- Update installer to not call DPInst.exe if directory already exists.
   DPInst.exe blindly re-installs or updates the .sys and .inf files which
   causes a new HW wizard to popup on a re-install. Just cutting down
   on annoyances.

- Ran some basic intall checks on Windows 7 with no significant issues,
  just a few dialogs to click through.

Release 4.0.0.32.20
- new xds510usb, cortex A8, C64+ to pickup SR12 updates all emulators

- added in xds560r SR12.  This adds the core windows files in the install
  but the CCS files are in a package for web install so that we do not
  over write the TI supplied files.

- Update xml board files

- change intaller to not remove the "program files\Spectrumdigital" directory.
  This seems to work on XP but does not work on Vista 64.  Looks to be a IJ
  issue as it is confused by "Program Files (x86)"

- Created automated build script to copy in SR12, xml, build, and pack the
  release.


Release 4.0.0.32.16
- new xds510usb to pickup Cortex M HW breakpoint fix. AET is now setting
  HW bps and has it normal issues.

- new PP driver for cortex M same as above.

- Remove icepick_bypass drivers and xml for emulators.

- Update configuration xml to use real ice_pick drivers.

- add a boards directory for configurations.
