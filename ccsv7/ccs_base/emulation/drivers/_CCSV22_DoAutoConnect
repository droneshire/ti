If the file "CCSV22_DoAutoConnect" is found in the 
<ccs_install_dir>\drivers directory then emulation
drivers will do auto connection to the target.  This
feature allows a CCS 2.4/3.x compliant SD driver to be
used in a CCS 2.2x environment.

The file "CCSV22_DoAutoConnect" should not be present
for CCS 2.4/3.x as it will cause CCS and emulation drivers
to get out of sync.. 

To enable CCS V22 auto-connection simply remove
the underscore in the file name:

_CCSV22_DoAutoConnect  >> CCSV22_DoAutoConnect

To disable CCS V22 auto-connection simply add the
underscore to the file name:

CCSV22_DoAutoConnect  >> _CCSV22_DoAutoConnect

If you want to have a dual CCS 2.2x and CCS 2.4/3.x
environment then you can either install the 2.4/3.x
drivers into both environments.  Or you can copy your
CCS 2.4x/3.x drivers to your CCS 2.2x install path.
If you do a copy then you will need to copy the following:

<install_dir>\specdig\sdconfig, full contents
<install_dir>\drivers, files with "sd" prefix.
Copy _CCSV22_DoAutoConnect  to CCSV22_DoAutoConnect in
the ccs 2.2x directory.
