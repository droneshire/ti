    RegsAddrOffset    = Core registers address offset, by register addressing type 
    RegsAddrType      = Registers addressing type, number of bytes per address 
    PC_AddrOffset     = PC register address offset, relative to registers or indirect port

    PC_Mask           = Mask for which bits in PC register are valid 
    PC_Shift          = Shift amount to align PC bits from register (+ means shift right)
    PC_Adjust         = Offset to normalize PC value to host address 
    SP_AddrOffset     = SP or FP register address offset, relative to registers or indirect port
    SP_IndPort        = Which indirect port to use to access SP
    SP_Mask           = Mask for which bits in SP register are valid

    CacheInvOffset    = Program cache invalidate register offset, relative to register offset
    CacheInvMask      = Mask for which bits are used in cache invalidate register
    CacheInvValue     = Cache invalidate value to trigger a global cache invalidate
    SWBP_Opcode       = Value of software breakpoint opcode 
    SWBP_Size         = Size, in bytes, of software breakpoint opcode 
    NumMemPages       = Number of memory pages (as per TPI, page 0 is always program page) 
    PageAddrOffset(x) = Memory page x address offset (x is a number from 0 to 15)  
    PageAddrType(x)   = Memory page x addressing type, number of bytes per address

                        Note that addressing type of the indirect port must be the 
                        same as the addressing type of the memory page.
