Texas Instruments C2000 USB Flash Programmer Example Package for F2837xD


This file describes how to reproduce the firmware upgrade example for F2837xD CPU01
and how the firmware upgrade works.

    * The blinky example can be found in ControlSuite in the
      device_support/F2837xD/{version_number}/F2837xD_examples_Cpu1 directory.
    * The F2837xD_usb_flash_kernels example can be found in ControlSuite in the
      device_support/F2837xD/{version_number}/F2837xD_examples_Dual/cpu01 directory.

The f2837xD_fw_upgrade_example directory contains the following files:

	* blinky_cpu01.dat: An input data file for usb_flash_programmer.exe containing
      the loadable sections of blinky_cpu01.out.
	* blinky_cpu01.out: A CCS compiled and linked executable program for F2837x
      which endlessly toggle GPIO31.
	* F2837xD_usb_flash_kernels_cpu01.dat: An input data file for usb_flash_programmer.exe
      containing the loadable sections of fw_upgrade_usb_kernels_cpu01.out
    * F2837xD_usb_flash_kernels_cpu01.out: A CCS compiled and linked executable
      program for F2837xD which loads an application from USB and programs it into Flash.
      This is used for a CPU01 firmware upgrade.

The .dat files were converted to the boot loader data format using hex2000, which
is part of the C2000 Code Generation Tools package. The correct command line is:

	hex2000.exe -boot -b blinky_cpu01.out -o blinky_cpu01.dat
	hex2000.exe -boot -b F2837xD_usb_flash_kernels_cpu01.out -o F2837xD_usb_flsah_kernels_cpu01.dat

If everything was done correctly, blinky_cpu01.dat and F2837xD_usb_flash_kernels_cpu01.dat
will now contain the loadable sections of the respective F2837xD executables in the correct format.

How the firmware upgrade works:
    The F2837xD is first put in USB Boot Mode.  Then the usb_flash_programmer.exe connects to the
F2837xD and does a bulk data transfer of F2837xD_usb_flash_kernels_cpu01.dat to the F2837xD.
After this load completes, the F2837xD branches to the start address of the kernel just
loaded in RAM.  This kernel then uses the USB to load the firmware upgrade application and
programs it into Flash.  In our example, the application is blinky_cpu01.dat.  This application
must be compiled and linked to run from Flash so that the kernel can use the Flash API to
upgrade the firmware in Flash.

Procedure:
    1) Boot the F2837xD in USB Boot Mode (see contents.txt, "Starting the MCU")
    2) Connect USB from Host PC to F2837xD.
    3) From the Host command line:
        usb_flash_programmer.exe  F2837xD_usb_flash_kernels_cpu01.dat  blinky_cpu01.dat
