A notation often used in the manifests is [as installed]/directory/*. Note that the asterisk implies that all

Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.<BR>8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.<BR>9. APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>a. United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.

Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
