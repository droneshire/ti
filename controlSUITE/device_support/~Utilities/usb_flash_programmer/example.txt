This file describes how to reproduce the example loader data file.


The loader_test_ccs directory contains a CCS 5.x project called
F28x7x_Loader_Test along with the following files:

	* F28x7x_Loader_Test.c: Main program. Endlessly toggles GPIO 10.
	* Extra_Data.c: A large constant data array to increase the size of the
	  loader data file.
	* F28x7x_Loader_Data.cmd: A linker command file that puts all of the
	  loadable sections into areas of RAM that are not used by the boot ROM.

The project links to several controlSUITE device support files. These links
are to version 120 of the F2837xD files, and may need to be changed for your
installation.

Compiling the project produces F28x7x_Loader_Test.out. This program disables
the watchdog to avoid unwanted resets, then endlessly toggles GPIO 10. An
optional ESTOP0 instruction may be uncommented to make the load completion
halt a CCS debug run.

The next step is to convert F28x7x_Loader_Test.out to the boot loader data
format. This is done using hex2000, which is part of the C2000 Code Generation
Tools package. The correct command line is:

	hex2000.exe -boot -b F28x7x_Loader_Test.out -o Loader_Test_Converted.dat

If everything was done correctly, Loader_Test_Converted.dat will now contain
the loadable sections of F28x7x_Loader_Test.out in the correct format.
