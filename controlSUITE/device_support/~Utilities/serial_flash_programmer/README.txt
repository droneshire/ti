Before running serial_flash_programmer.exe, the microcontroller must be attached
to a COM port, must be running the SCI boot loader. If these conditions are met, 
the following command will load the included example programs:

	serial_flash_programmer.exe  -d f2837xD -k F2837xD_sci_flash_kernels_cpu01.txt  -a blinky_cpu01.txt 
                                 -b 9600 -p COM7

F2802x, F2803x, F2805x, F2806x Usage:

The serial flash programmer for these devices runs strictly from the command line.  The only
option and function supported is a device firmware upgrade.  It downloads the kernel to the device which
which running the sci boot loader and then branches to the kernel.  The host PC then performs 
an autobaud lock with the kernel and then sends the flash application to the kernel which receives 
the data, erases and programs the flash.
            
F2837xS, F2807x Usage:

The program reads the input file data into memory, then attempts to open the
COM port and sends a word by word transfer containing the kernel data in ASCII boot format.
The boot loader of the device copies the incoming data into RAM, then branches to 
the specified entry point.  At this point the flash kernel is running.  The host application 
then waits for input from the user from command line and requests any necessary data to 
send to the device running the kernel.  Below are the possible options given to the user of 
the flash programming solution...
•	DFU
•	Erase 
•	Verify 
•	Unlock Zone 1
•	Unlock Zone 2
•	Run CPU1
•	Reset CPU1
•	Done

DFU stands for device firmware upgrade and erases, programs and verifies the necessary flash sectors.
The DFU options use the input flash application files which must be in the appropriate format as
described below.  The Verify function also uses these input files to send to the device so that
it can verify the flash contents.  When Erase is selected, the application requests which sectors
to erase from the user on the command line.  When Unlock is selected, the application requests
for four 32-bit passwords in hex from the user from standard input.  When Run is selected, the 
application requests the entry point address to branch to.  When Reset is selected, the command is 
sent to the device and the device performs a watchdog reset and the application exits.
            
F2837xD Dual Core Soprano Usage:                         
                                 
The program reads the input file data into memory, then attempts to open the
COM port and sends a word by word transfer containing the kernel data in ASCII boot format.
The boot loader of the device copies the incoming data into RAM, then branches to 
the specified entry point.  At this point the flash kernel is running.  The host application 
then waits for input from the user from command line and requests any necessary data to 
send to the device running the kernel.  Below are the possible options given to the user of 
the flash programming solution...
•	DFU CPU1
•	DFU CPU2
•	Erase CPU1
•	Erase CPU2
•	Verify CPU1
•	Verify CPU2
•	Unlock CPU1 Zone 1
•	Unlock CPU1 Zone 2
•	Unlock CPU2 Zone 1
•	Unlock CPU2 Zone 2
•	Run CPU1
•	Reset CPU1
•	Run CPU1 Boot CPU2
•	Reset CPU1 Boot CPU2
•	Run CPU2
•	Reset CPU2
•	Done

DFU stands for device firmware upgrade and erases, programs and verifies the necessary flash sectors.
The DFU options use the input flash application files which must be in the appropriate format as
described below.  The Verify function also uses these input files to send to the device so that
it can verify the flash contents.  When Erase is selected, the application requests which sectors
to erase from the user on the command line.  When Unlock is selected, the application requests
for four 32-bit passwords in hex from the user from standard input.  When Run is selected, the 
application requests the entry point address to branch to.  When Reset is selected, the command is 
sent to the device and the device performs a watchdog reset and the application exits.

When the application starts, the serial connection is with the SCI module which is owned by CPU1.
Only commands designated for CPU1 are acceptable at this point before booting CPU2.  If a CPU2 command
is selected, the application asks the user for a different option.  After booting to CPU2, either with
"Run CPU1 Boot CPU2" or "Reset CPU1 Boot CPU2," CPU1 relinquishes the SCI module and Flash pump to CPU2.
Therefore, the host application then prohibits any CPU1 commands to be selected and only allows 
communication with CPU2 from that point forward.

The Flash Kernel:

The flash kernel communicates with the host via the SCI module.  It waits for commands from the 
host and sends an ACK or NAK depending whether or not the packet was received properly.  The 
kernel has the ability to unlock zones 1 and 2, program a flash application, verify the contents
of the flash, erase the flash (all or specific sectors), and finally either run the core by
branching to a specific entry point address or reset the core with a watchdog timer.

Input File Format:

The input files (kernel and flash application) must be a ASCII file containing only data in 
the standard boot loader format. This format is described in the ROM Code and Peripheral Booting
chapter of the device TRM and is reproduced below for convenience. To convert
a .out file compiled by Code Composer Studio into the required format, use the
hex2000 tool, which is part of the C2000 Code Generation Tools package:

	hex2000 -boot -a -sci8 <.out filename> -o <output filename>

Boot loader data format:
The Serial boot loader data follows the same format as the other peripheral boot loaders.
