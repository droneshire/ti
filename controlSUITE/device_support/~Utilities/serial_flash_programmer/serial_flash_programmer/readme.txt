Texas Instruments C2000 Serial Flash Programmer Example Package


The serial_flash_programmer.sln should be loaded into Visual Studio
and built in Visual Studio.  Although the source files contain some C++ 
for linux within some #defines, we have NOT yet compiled and tested it 
to run on linux machines.

The resulting serial_flash_programmer.exe should be run from the command line.
